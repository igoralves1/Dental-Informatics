### [AWS HIPAA](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/)
>A growing number of healthcare providers, payers, and IT professionals are using AWS's utility-based cloud services to process, store, and transmit protected health information (PHI). AWS enables covered entities and their business associates subject to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to use the secure AWS environment to process, maintain, and store protected health information. For detailed information about how you can use AWS for the processing and storage of health information, see the whitepaper Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance on Amazon Web Services.

[Project Alvearie](https://alvearie.io/)
> Project Alvearie seeks to help healthcare tech professionals unlock and effectively use healthcare data to solve the biggest challenges in healthcare.
> Healthcare data is often trapped in a maze of digital applications or records systems that don’t interoperate. As a result, healthcare technology professionals are limited in their ability to bring data, technology, and clinical expertise together to transform healthcare for providers, payers, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and other healthcare organizations.
>
> A new open source project from IBM Watson Health — Project Alvearie — seeks to help healthcare technology professionals unlock and effectively use healthcare data to solve some of the biggest challenges in healthcare.

>Collaborators will have an opportunity to contribute to the different components and services that make up Alvearie, including:
>>[Linux for Health](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/docs/): Welcome to the future of healthcare software development - the world’s first true enabled HealthOS. LinuxForHealth is a distributed processing network operating system which allows mainframes, cloud and edge devices to be seamlessly connected directly to healthcare transaction systems. The processing model abstracts the need for intermediary third-party organizations, resulting in a developer-extensible trust protocol. The LinuxForHealth architecture builds on successive levels of industry standards, from AMD64, ARM64 and NVIDIA chip architectures to Docker and PodMan containers, supporting an extensible set of APIs accessible via multiple languages.
>>
>>[The Quality Measure and Cohort Service](https://alvearie.io/quality-measure-and-cohort-service/#/): The IBM® Cohort and Quality Measure Service supports evaluation of cohorts defined in Clinical Quality Language CQL and clinical quality measures defined using FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Measure resource syntax.
>>
>>[The IBM FHIR Server](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/): The IBM FHIR Server is a modular Java implementation of version 4 of the HL7 FHIR specification with a focus on performance and configurability.
